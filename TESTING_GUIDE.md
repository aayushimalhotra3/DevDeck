## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: GitHub OAuth not working
- **Solution**: Check GitHub app configuration and redirect URLs

### Database Issues
- **Problem**: Connection timeouts
- **Solution**: Verify MongoDB connection string and network access

### CORS Issues
- **Problem**: Frontend can't connect to backend
- **Solution**: Check CORS configuration in backend

### Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Slow page loads
- **Solution**: Optimize images, enable compression, check database queries
